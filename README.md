Hi there! I am a software engineer specializing in building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences as well as responsive websites and web applications. I began this journey while I was working for a small family owned clothing company as a sales manager. While employed there, I learned HTML and CSS in order to help with the success of their website launch. Since then, I used my new skills to freelance while I was in school obtaining a degree in Health Sciences. Little did I know that freelancing would be the catalyst of a major, pivotal change in my life.
I realized that creating digital experiences was indeed my passion, and decided to pursue a career as a Software Engineer. The project I'm working on currently is a Patient Portal Software. Some technologies that I have been working with recently are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js
