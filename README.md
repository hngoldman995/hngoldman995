<hr>

What I love most about programming is getting to build digital experiences. I'm even fond of the challenges that come with it. I compare these challenges to solving a puzzle, where usually the missing puzzle piece is a syntax error. Learning never ends in this field, and I consider myself a perpetual student in all areas of my life, always striving to grow and improve.
