What I love most about programming is getting to build digital experiences. I'm even fond of the obstacles and challenges that come with it. I compare these challenges to solving a puzzle, where more often than not, the missing puzzle piece is something as small as a dreaded syntax error. Learning never ends in this field and I consider myself a perpetual student in all areas of my life. Whether its improving a flawed software, or learning a new language, I am always making an effort to improve and grow.
